<p>The four tools work together to address two types of situations.</p>
<p>If you lose mental capacity</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://mylegacy.life.gov.sg/find-a-service/acp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Advance Care Planning</a> (ACP)
helps your doctors and those you trust to tailor your care and treatment
in a way that respects your preferences, when you are not able to speak
for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://mylegacy.life.gov.sg/find-a-service/lpa/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Lasting Power of Attorney</a> (LPA)
gives one or more persons you choose and trust the legal right to make
decisions on your behalf when necessary. These decisions cover your personal
welfare, property and bank accounts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the same trusted persons to speak on your behalf in both your LPA
and ACP to avoid potential disagreements on how to care for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you pass away</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://mylegacy.life.gov.sg/end-of-life-planning/write-a-will/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">will</a> sets
out how you would like your assets to be distributed. However, your CPF
savings will not be covered by a will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making a <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/account-services/providing-for-your-loved-ones/making-a-cpf-nomination" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CPF nomination</a> ensures
your CPF savings are distributed according to your wishes. It also allows
your loved ones to quickly receive your CPF savings upon your death. Without
a CPF nomination, it can take up to six months for the Public Trusteeâ€™s
Office to identify which of your family members are eligible to claim your
savings. An administrative fee will also be deducted from your savings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sudden death and loss of mental capacity can happen to any of us. Don't wait till it's too late. Plan your legacy today.</h4>
