<p>It’s not easy to broach the topic of legacy planning - whether that’s
about your own plans or encouraging someone else to make theirs Here’s

<h4><strong>How do I have conversations about my legacy plans?</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Begin with your story</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Everyone starts doing legacy planning for different reasons. A good way
to begin these conversations is to share your personal whys - your motivation,
your journey, and how it gives you peace of mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Break down your legacy planning into digestible topics</u></strong>

</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

tied with the nomination and assure them that it comes from a <strong>place of trust</strong>.</p>
</li>

has led you to decide on nominating them <strong>whilst assuring them</strong> that
if they don’t wish to take this on, your relationship stays the same.</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledge that they may have concerns</strong> such as financial
burden, scope of responsibilities and time frame, <strong>and make the effort to address them</strong>.</p>

<p>Share resources that may help them understand things better - such as

<p><strong><u>Dont' forget other loved ones</u></strong>
</p>
<p>It’s still important to <strong>communicate your decisions with other loved ones</strong> that
you have not appointed to act on your behalf. This can <strong>ease future misunderstandings</strong> and
ensure everyone feels <strong>respected and included</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>How do I encourage someone to make their legacy plans?</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Prepare for the conversation</u></strong>
</p>
<p>It can be challenging to broach this topic, especially when the other
person is reluctant to discuss it or has not thought about legacy planning. <strong>Respect their point-of-view and prepare for the conversation</strong> so
that you have a reference to look at when the conversation gets a little
difficult.</p>
<p>It helps if the <strong>conversation is initiated by someone close to them</strong>.
If the person is a senior, you may also want to <strong>note terms in their preferred language</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Speak in a manner that connects</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledge their concerns.</strong> Respect that there may be
cultural taboos and address them as the conversation develops.</p>
<p><strong>Identify key values</strong> they hold that may be good motivators
for them to start, e.g. preserving family harmony, filial piety, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Use simple language</strong> so that they understand what you are
explaining.</p>
<p>If you’re up for it, <strong>offer to carry out the responsibilities relating to their legacy plans</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduce Topics Gradually</u></strong>
