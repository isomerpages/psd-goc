<p>Would you like your body to be cremated or buried?</p>
<p>Who should be the guardian or your kids should you pass away?</p>
<p>How should your assets and CPF be split?</p>
<p>Your loved ones inheriting your assets and monies isn’t such a straightforward
affair if you have not made a will or registered your CPF nomination. Besides
the extra time taken to sort out your worldly possessions through the courts,
you may open up potential conflict between legal beneficiaries. What’s
worse, the ones you wanted to receive your assets might not get them in
the end as you have not legally recorded your last wishes.</p>
<p>There are simply two things you need to do to settle these issues:</p>
<h4>Will</h4>
<p>A will governs the distribution of a person’s assets after they have passed
on. The person making the will would be able to specify who he or she wants
to execute his or her wishes (the executor); what monies/assets he or she
wishes to distribute under the will; the recipients of the assets (the
beneficiaries) after he or she passes on; and the manner of distribution
– in other words, what percentage of his or her assets each beneficiary
will be given.</p>
<h4>CPF Nomination</h4>
<p>By making a CPF nomination, you gain the flexibility to decide who should
receive your CPF savings. You can specify one or more nominees, ensuring
that your wishes are respected. Your nominee(s) will receive your CPF savings
more quickly—generally within five weeks—without any fees charged. This
expedited process can be crucial during challenging times.</p>
