<h4>If you are afflicted with Alzheimer's, would you choose to stay at home or in a nursing centre?</h4>
<h4>Would you sell your house to fund your medical treatment?</h4>
<h4>Would you want to go through the pain of dialysis or live the rest of your days pain-free?</h4>
<p>If you can’t make these tough decisions yourself, imagine the emotional
burden you will be placing on your loved ones when they have to because
you are mentally incapacitated.
<br>To ensure you have control of your medical care, as well as relieve your
loved ones of decisions they have to live with, do up your Advanced Medical
Care and Lasting Power of Attorney now while you can.</p>

<p>A lasting power of attorney is a beacon of support and reassurance, offering
a guiding hand during life’s unexpected twists and turns. It’s like appointing
a trusted friend or family member to be your steadfast ally, empowered
to make decisions on your behalf if you’re ever unable to do so yourself.
Like a comforting embrace in times of uncertainty, it ensures that your
journey continues smoothly, with someone you trust steering the ship when
the waters get rough.</p>

<h4>ADVANCE CARE PLAN (ACP)</h4>

<p>Making an ACP helps you to communicate to your loved ones and healthcare
team about your values and how these values shape your healthcare preferences.
Your ACP can help make decision-making less stressful for your family and
ensure that your preferences are heard, even when you can no longer speak
for yourself.</p>
