<p>Without legacy planning, your loved ones may face high legal fees, administrative
charges, and medical costs due to prolonged decision-making. Save significant
costs and safeguard their future. Take action today with one of these tools.</p>
<h4><strong>Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Appoint someone you trust to make decisions regarding
your personal welfare, property and affairs in the event that you lose
mental capacity.</p>
<p><strong>How it reduces extra costs: </strong>Without an LPA in place,<strong> </strong>those
caring for you will have to apply for the legal right to manage your affairs.
In the event that they are unable to manage daily expenses, they will have
to apply for the right to access your savings. Avoid costly court applications
and legal disputes over who should manage your affairs.</p>
