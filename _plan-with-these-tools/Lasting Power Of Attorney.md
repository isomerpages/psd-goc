<h4>If you suffer a sudden stroke and lose your mental capacity, would your dependents be able to pay the household bills?</h4>
<h4>Would you have to sell your house to fund your medical treatment?</h4>
<h4>Should you suffer early-onset dementia, what happens to your bank accounts and investments?</h4>
<p>Accidents, illnesses, or age-related conditions can strike at any time.

and personal matters if you lose mental capacity. Without one, your loved
ones may face costly court procedures to manage your affairs.</p>
<p>Empowering someone you trust with the legal authority to make decisions
on your behalf will also prevent any conflict amongst your family that
arise from your condition.</p>
