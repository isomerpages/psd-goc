<h2><strong>Take Control of Your Future Care Today.</strong></h2>
<p>Free your loved ones from the burden of making medical decisions for you
by making an Advance Care Plan.</p>

<h4>If you are afflicted with Alzheimer's, would you choose to stay at home or in a nursing centre?</h4>
<h4>Should you have end-stage cancer, would you prefer a pain- free treatment or is your priority to prolong your life?</h4>
<h4>Would you want to go through the pain of dialysis or live the rest of your days pain-free?</h4>
<p>Accidents and sudden illnesses can happen any time, robbing you of the
ability to communicate your wishes or leaving you mentally incapacitated.
Making an Advance Care Plan (ACP) when you're healthy and of sound mind
helps you to convey your wishes and healthcare preferences to your loved
ones and healthcare team. Your ACP makes decision-making less stressful
for your family and ensure that your preferences are heard, even when you
can no longer speak for yourself.</p>
